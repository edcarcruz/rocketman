# Project Description
Let's get the Rocketman to space! The player has to guess the unknown word with a total of 6 lives. Using letters of the alphabet the player must choose letters that match the given word. If the player fails to guess the word completely within 6 lives the rocket blasts off into space without the rocketman.
